# lookCloser

I wanted to make something that was reminiscent of old games and that brought the idea of you interacting directly with the game and you being the main character. I brought some elements of suspense and puzzle, to our beloved console.

It was developed during an introductory Python module as the final project, in just 1 week. I had no prior knowledge of the language.

## ⚠️ If you have a camera, this game uses it, just for the gameplay and nothing else

If I had more time, I would like to better develop the sites and the puzzles within them. I would add new mechanics and use a graphical interface.
